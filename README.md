# WallStall

# How to use
install the requiments from requirements.txt with 
> "pip3 install -r requirements.txt"

for distros like arch you'll be needing to install requiments from pacman, 
>sudo pacman -S python-pyqt5 python-requests

and start the app with

>"./start"

then you can type your query in search bar, you can selec whether you want nsfw, sfw, or sketchy wallpapers, you can select general, anime or people,
you can specify resolution in resolution bar seperated with comma like "1920x1080,1280x720", you can sort from drop box.
As of now this app provides wallpapers only from wallheaven.cc 

# Features
1. If you want to surf "NSFW" or "SKETCHY" wallpaper you'll be needing wallheaven's API key, you can add the wallheaven.cc api key from https://wallhaven.cc/settings/account and copy the API
  then open the app. Click on "Edit" from menubar, then preferences then go to "API" tab, there you'll be needing to paste your API key, you can also use
  "Authenticate" button to check whether the API key copied is correct or not. Then click on "Save" and Restart the app.
2. Able to specify a "Default save location" for downloads, click on Edit, preferences, then type or click on browse button, choose the directory, /home/user/Pictures
   and click on Save, and wallpapers will be downloaded to the default location when  "Use Default Save location" checked.
3. Able to mute/disable the "Saved the Image" pop-up, as i also find that annoying, so for that, Edit > preference > check "disable saved image pop-up message"

# Warning
This app downloads the wallpaper from source, and hence one having a limited internet connection MUST AVOID using it. 

# Future Plans
I wanted to make an app from which i can surf wallpapers and apply "Effects" to it, like the effects avaible in Natron, Glow, CC, Godrays, etc.
so this will my future plan, and will be improving the app based on the feedback.
